first of all, you need to put xml files in the same directory as the videokeptur.py, and youre set!

You would need:
- Open CV
- PyautoGUI
- Pydirectinput (if your pyautogui aint doing things)

I'm sorry for NOT uploading the cleaner code, eventho I could. I was trying different approaches to make this code works faster. At the end of the day, you have to take your own losses and realize you dont have a zeus laptop. 

I'm using a and l key for mario to run and jump. If you wanna know more about how the code works, please hit me up.
